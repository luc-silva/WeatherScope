## How to test it locally

First, download the repository into your machine:
``bash
git clone https://github.com/luc-silva/weather-app``

Go to project directory:
``bash
cd /home/[user]/[location]/weather-app``

Install dependencies:
``bash
npm install``

And then, start your localhost server:
``bash
npm start``

## Plans for the future

- Refactor the whole project
